## Altschool Second Semester Examination

Implement an API fetch of your GitHub portfolio, show a page with a list of all your repositories on GitHub(the page should implement pagination for the repo list), and create another page showing data for a single repo clicked from the list of repos using nested routes while using all the necessary tools in react. Implement the proper SEO, Error Boundary (show a page to test the error boundary) and 404 pages. Good UI and Designs are important. 

## APPROACH

Created nested routes using react-router-dom, made API calls to the github API and data set to state inside a useEffect hook, implemented pagination and implemented SEO with react-helmet-async.
